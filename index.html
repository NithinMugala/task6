            SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
        </h1>
    </u>
        <P>
            The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. 
        </P>

        <h3>1.Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            .Identifying the purpose of the software, defining requirements, estimating costs, and setting goals and timelines.
            <br>
            .Planning helps outline the scope, resources, and schedule.
        </p>
        <h3>2.System Analysis:</h3>
        <p>
           . Assessing the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the project.
           <br>
           . Determining if the project is viable and worth pursuing.
        </p>
        <h3>3.System design:</h3>
        <p>.Defining system architecture and design.
            <br>
           . Creating high-level and low-level design documents that include database design, software architecture, and user interfaces.

        </p>
        <h3>4.Implementation(Coding/Development):</h3>
        <p>
       .Writing the actual code based on the system design documents.
       <br>
        .Developers implement the functionalities defined in the design phase.
        </p>
        <h3>5.Testing:</h3>
        <p>
            .Testing the software to identify bugs and ensure it functions correctly.
            <br>
             .Types of testing may include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
        </p>
        <h3>6.Deployment:</h3>
        <p>
            .Deploying the software to a live environment for end-users.
            <br>
             .In some cases, deployment might be done in stages (e.g., beta testing, phased rollout).
        </p>
        <h3>7.Maintenance and Support:</h3>
        <p>
            .After deployment, the software may require updates, bug fixes, and ongoing support to ensure it remains functional.
            <br>
            .Maintenance can involve patches, performance optimization, or adding new features.

         <h1> HOW THREE TIER ARCHITECTURE:</h1>
         </u>
         <p>
            In three tier Architecture we are having three layers they are:
<br>
1.Presentation Tier
<br>
2.Logical Tier
<br>
3.Data Tier
         </p>
         <b>1.Presentation Tier:</b>In presentaton layer as from developer's point of <mark>view we can view the data or we can collect the data</mark>.
         <br>
         <b>EX:</b>let us take any application in that Register page we can view and through that register page we can collect the data.
         <br>
         <b>2.Logic Tier:</b>br>In logic tier we will write the logics for the validation of data and for more logical things.
         <br>
         <b>EX:</b>Validation
         <br>
         <b>3.Data Tier:</b>In these tier we will store the data which will comes from the Front end as well as Data that we need to store.
         <br>
         <b>EX:</b>My SQL
    
    <u>
    <h1>HOW FULL STACK APPLICATION WORKS</h1>
    </u>
    <p>
        1.By using some technologies we can develop a full stack application such as E-commerce website.

The Technologies are such as:
<br>

.HTML
<br>
.CSS
<br>
.JAVASCRIPT
<br>
.NODE.JS
<br>
.SQL
<br>
To Understand better let us consider an Example such as<mark> Register page</mark>.
<br>

    </p>
    
        <h3>EXPLAINATION:</h3>
        <p>

2.firstly by using Html we can create a UI (user interface) and we will add styling to that user interface.
<br>
3.After opening the application we will get one Register page if we click on the that we will get some credentials such as {username, password, DOB, etc} .
<br>
4.after we enter the credentials such as Username and password and DOB then the data will be sent to the backend through API
<br>
5.let us consider my API as Register API by using this it will sent the data to the backend.
<br>
6.In backend we will write the logics such as for the validation of the data.
<br>
7.For example the credentials what we have entered in UI it will comes to backend through API and if the Username or Password is already exist then it will send the message as username Already Exist. If not it will says that you have registered successfully.
<br>
8.The new data which came from the FE it will be stored in the database.
<br>
9.So this whole process runs as a request ->Response format.
<br>
10.So this Whole process is known as the Full stack application.

    <h1>web Application & Stand Alone Application:</h1>
    </u>
    <p>
        <b>Web Application:</b>The application that works when the internet is available if the internet is not available then it does not work then it is known as the web application
<br>
1.Accessible from any device with an internet connection and a browser
<br>
2.No installation required on the userâ€™s device; the application is accessed over the internet.
<br>
<b>EX</b>:Netflix , Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc.
<br>
Standalone Application: The Applicaion that does not require any internet if there is no internet also it will work then that application is known as Standalone applocation.
<br>
1.Installed directly on a user's local device (desktop, laptop, etc.).
<br>
2.Accessible only from the device where it is installed.
<br>
3.Requires installation and may require periodic updates.
<br>
<b>EX:</b>Microsoft Word, calculator, photos, etc.
    </p>
